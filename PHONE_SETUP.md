# ðŸ“ž Phone-Based AI Booking Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up **real phone number integration** so customers can call and make reservations using voice commands.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Customers will be able to:
1. **Call your restaurant's phone number**
2. **Speak their booking request** (name, party size, date, time)
3. **Receive immediate confirmation** via voice
4. **Automatically create bookings** in your system

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Get Twilio Account (Phone Service)

1. **Sign up**: Go to [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com) and create account
2. **Get free trial**: Twilio gives $15 credit to start
3. **Buy a phone number**: 
   - Go to Phone Numbers â†’ Manage â†’ Buy a number
   - Choose a local number for your restaurant
   - Cost: ~$1/month for the number

### 2. Get Your Twilio Credentials

In Twilio Console, find:
- **Account SID**: Found on main dashboard
- **Auth Token**: Click "show" on main dashboard  
- **Phone Number**: The number you purchased (format: +1234567890)

### 3. Add Credentials to .env File

Edit `server/.env`:
```env
MISTRAL_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
SERVER_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### 4. Deploy Your Server (Required for Phone Calls)

Twilio needs a **public URL** to send webhooks. Options:

#### Option A: Ngrok (For Testing)
```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Start your server locally
npm start

# In another terminal, expose it publicly
ngrok http 3001

# Copy the https URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
```

#### Option B: Deploy to Cloud (Production)
- **Railway**: Connect GitHub, auto-deploy
- **Heroku**: `git push heroku main`  
- **Render**: Connect repo, one-click deploy

### 5. Configure Twilio Webhook

1. **Go to Twilio Console** â†’ Phone Numbers â†’ Manage â†’ Active Numbers
2. **Click your phone number**
3. **In "Voice Configuration"**:
   - Webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/voice`
   - HTTP Method: `POST`
4. **Save configuration**

### 6. Test Your Phone Booking System

1. **Call your Twilio number**
2. **Say something like**: *"Hi, this is John Smith, I'd like a table for 4 people tomorrow at 7 PM"*
3. **Listen for confirmation**
4. **Check your booking system** - the reservation should appear automatically!
